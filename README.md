Mods I've made for sm64coopdx

## sm64ds-luigi-voice
Replaces the voice clips on Luigi for High quality versions of the ones Luigi uses in Super Mario 64 DS. High quality versions are found in games of the same era (Luigi's mansion, Mario Golf, Mario Kart GP DX etc.). Not all high quality versions of Luigi's voice clips are public unfortunately, and for those ones the original Super Mario 64 DS versions are used.
### sm64ds-luigi-voice-all-hq
Except in this version, where the missing high quality versions of Luigi's voice clips are replaced with other high quality sounds that match the actions.
